Shruthi-1, a digital/analog hybrid MIDI monosynth.

This project is a redesign of the original Shruti-1, with a spec'ed up CPU,
and a focus on easy upgrades/modification of the analog section.
The ATMega644p allows new features in the firmware -- a larger selection of
oscillator algorithms, a bigger selection of wavetables, and a tiny sequencer.

Original developer: Olivier Gillet (ol.gillet@gmail.com)

The firmware is released under a GPL3.0 license. It includes a
reimplementation of the formant synthesis algorithm used in Peter Knight's
Cantarino speech synthesizer.

The PCB layouts and schematics (in /hardware/shruthi/design/pcb)
are released under a Creative Commons cc-by-sa 3.0 license - except for some
discontinued filter boards which were released under a cc-by-nc-sa 3.0 license.

Documentation, analyses, simulations and 3D models are released under a
